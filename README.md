🧪 In my first life I was a biologist ! Working in reaseach in the field of human health and mostly cellular therapy ! 💊
🔬 In my second life I wanted to get closer to the people I could help so I became a technical support in the scientific machinery field and guided customer toward what was best for their projects ! 🎯
😺 In my third life I gained new knowledges to start my solo project ! I created my own job as cat behaviourist and helped people and cats understand each other so that they could live peacfully ! 🙏
